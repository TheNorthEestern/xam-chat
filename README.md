# XamChat
## Currently WIP

To get started, install [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com), clone this repo,
navigate to the solution file in your cloned repo and you should be good
to go. 

Note: While XamChar.Core is a [PCL](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/application_fundamentals/pcl/introduction_to_portable_class_libraries/), the only UI code in this project is for Xamarin.iOS
